In the west, Nationalist French forces are attempting to encircle our forces by spearheading through Benin. It is clear to even the most stubborn generals that we must sacrifice one of these fronts to prevent a total collapse of the Schutztruppe. The majority of high command is in favour of evacuating the West African front and retreat to Kamerun, where the friendly locals and strategically advantageous Sanaga River will assist us in our fight against the French. A small minority however argue that S端dwestafrika must be sacrificed, and attempting to hold onto it would cost us far too greatly in resources and manpower that we can not spare. Though the latter proposal is more sound strategically, the political fallout will be enormous. S端dwestafrika has a sizeable amount of German settlers, and being one of Germany's original colonies, abandoning it without a fight will anger many hardliners in our already weakened administration. What shall we do?

	desc = "EVTTSS_21_DESC" #With the Entente vultures closing in on all sides, that begs the question of the status of the British colonies that we currently occupy. Though local British administrators have declared their neutrality, we suspect that they must be secretly arming themselves, waiting to rise up in support of Canada once the time strikes. However, they are still contributing to our war effort by keeping tax revenue flowing to Darussalam and by maintaining civil authority. The Anglo colonials' loyalties are dubious, but if we strike down on them too hard, the situation might worsen for us.

	desc = "EVTTSS_22_DESC" #The Belgian Congo is one of the few colonies that maintained its relative autonomy from the rest of Mittelafrika. This is in part due to the Belgians having already entrenched themselves in native administration and economy, making it much easier just to let them do the job for us. However, now that Entente forces now closing in, rumors are abounding that the Force Publique, the Congo's colonial police force, and the administrators are preparing to rise up in support of Leopold III and his Free Belgium government based in Canada. Though this is only a rumor, it would be wise for us to take a look and assess the situation. Some more militaristic generals are demanding that we end the Belgian administration based on this rumor alone, despite the obvious fallout that would result from dismantling the Congo's administration overnight.
