Zhang Xueliang on the other hand won't know these specific machines as well, but can whip the corps into shape and focus on doctrine and organization, meaning his tech team helps researching air doctrine faster at the cost of aircraft research

He has been one of Marshal Zhang's most stalwart allies, but age has caught up to him and he has said he would rather look out for his health and spend the rest of his days in peace. After such a bittersweet farewell, we must make an important decision: the new governor of Heilongjiang province. Several candidates have come to our attention. Zhang Jinghui is another of the Old Marhsal's associates and old allies, and his connections to the Concordia Association may help bring Japanese investment to the impoverished province, at the cost of increasing Mantetsu's influence even further in the Northeast. Chang Yinhuai, a close associated of Yang Yuting, promises to put down rebellious elements in the province, but his associations with the ambitious Shikan Clique make his ultimate loyalty questionable. Wan Fulin is also a militia leader, but instead is an associate of the Young Marshal, and while he may seem ineffectual against enemy aggression he could be key in helping consolidate our position in the province and promote modernization. Last but not least is Ma Zhanshan, an ethnic Manchu who has long been a standard bearer of the Old Marshal. While of a mixed reputation among the officers here, he is a personal friend of Zhang Xueliang and has a lot of sway with the local Manchu and Mongol princes - connections that could prove critical down the line.

It is no secret they resent how much control Fengtian province has over the clique and they have constantly been agitating for greater representation and autonomy. Our setbacks against the Zhili have only emboldened these rebellious dogs, and there is talk now of an independence movement that is gaining traction with the local elites, merchants, and miners. We have also received word that some of its leaders are in contact with Japanese intelligence - possibly  to use Jilin as insurance against us! Now is the time for us to address this issue. Jilin has a provincial assembly, but it is currently dominated by us. Giving them more autonomy and allowing them to choose their own governor may help ease the tension, although they are bound to choose Yu Yuanpu, a noted separatist and enemy of Marshal Zhang. We could strengthen the assembly but ensure the election of one of our own men, Zhang Zuoxiang - the locals will like us less, but it could keep them pacified. We could also forget this matter - let them shout all the want, but show them who's boss in the end.
