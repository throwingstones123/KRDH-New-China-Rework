name = "The Empire of the Great Qing" 
desc = "EVT_149999_DESC" #It is the 9th year of the Imperial Restoration. The Xuantong Emperor reigns - Heaven accedes to the Middle Kingdom! Unfortunately the truth is a little more complicated: Puyi Aisin Gioro is but a mere figurehead of the Zhili clique, who use the Imperial restoration as front and are the true masters in Beijing. The Assembly President, Cao Kun, is however an alcoholic old wreck of a man, and more and more power is being concentrated into the office of Wu Peifu, de facto leader of the Northern Zhili. Nonetheless, the situation is stable as of right now: the Qing enjoy the patronage of the German Empire, with whose backing the Qing are able to claim authority in all of China. The warlords, for now, are subdued, save Zhang Zuolin, the Japanese puppet leader of the Fengtian Clique which dominates the Emperor's traditional homeland of Manchuria. Meanwhile, the League of Eight Provinces, led by Southern Zhili warlord Sun Chuanfang, maintains at least nominal Qing authority elsewhere in China - although it is obvious that his power hangs by a thread, and if the League collapses it will certainly send the whole region descending into warlord chaos once more. Elsewhere, we have to suffer the continued loss of territory to The Mad Baron in Mongolia, as well as the squabbling Muslim warlords in the Ma Clique and the distant Xinjiang. Intrigue permeates the Middle Kingdom. The Japanese plot to make another bid to dominate China. Warlords and Republicans seek to undo the Restoration of our monarchy, and bring down the Zhili hegemony once and for all. The Legation Cities are rife with Outsiders and Triads, seeking to carve China's future in their own image and line their pockets with its riches. Time will tell who will emerge victorious: We can only wait and see who earns the Mandate of Heaven.

Originally one of several warlord factions squabbling for power after the Xinhai Revolution, Cao Kun and Sun Chuanfang were able to secure German support and repulse both the Fengtian Clique and the KMT's Northern Expedition. They rule now respectively in the North and South, but tensions are high and rhe fall of the LEP would spell doom for the Southern Zhili. In the North, we are faced with our own problems: President Cao Kun is a miserable alcoholic who is increasingly incapable of running the government. Wu Peifu has taken on more and more responsibility, and it is a matter of time before he becomes outright leader of the Northern Zhili. We are also faced with increase calls for reform, and Puyi himself has grown restless in the Foribbden City. Combined with the machinations of the surrounding warlords and the Japanese, the Zhili-Qing alliance can expect some grievous tests on the horizon...
