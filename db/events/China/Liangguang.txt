The Viceroyalty of Liangguang was first created during the Ming Dynasty, but would be dissolved and reformed numerous times until its final dissolution in 1911. Its official name was the lengthy "Governor-General, Commander and Quartermaster, Supervisor of Waterways, and Inspector-General of the Two Expanses (Guangs) and Surrounding Areas.Guangdong province is one of the most wealthy and developed parts of China, with Guangzhou rivaling Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beijing. However, its recent history is marred with warfare and destruction, with the province losing Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhouwan to Western imperialists in the 19th century, while the Xinhai Revolution eventually brought further ruin by numerous wars between warlords and the turbulent rule of the Kuomintang. Since the failure of the Northern Expedition in 1926, the province has been governed Chen Jiongming and has seen a remarkable recovery and growth, developing a young provincial democracy in the process.\n\nGuangxi, meanwhile, has been ruled by Lu Rongting, who is seen as the quintessential warlord. The province has been highly militarized and its soldiers are well-known across China to be some of the best. However, this high level of militarization has been costly, and the wealthier Guangdong has been essentially keeping the Guangxi Army afloat, creating an interdependent relationship between the two provinces as Guangxi troops often supplement the smaller Guangdong Army.

This has hurt the Governor's credibility in the eyes of the people and strengthened the radicals' popularity.

desc = "EVT_152027_DESC"#Up until now, the Productive People's Party, led by Chen Mingshu and representing the majority of members of the Kuomintang in Liangguang, has been collaborating with Chen Jiongming's big-tent republican coalition. The Nationalists were happy to help develop and participate in democratic institutions in order to protect their interests and legacy after the failed Northern Expedition. This was with the long-term goal of peacefully implementing Mínquán, Sun Yat-sen's Principle of popular government. Besides, Chen's Federalists protected them from Zhili and Qing retribution.\n\nLi Zongren's seizure of Guangxi has completely changed the situation. While Chen Mingshu hardly trusts the rightist warlord despite both being members of the KMT, a golden opportunity presents itself: If he could get rid of Chen Jiongming, Liangguang would be secured for the Nationalist Party without bloodshed. He remains hesitant to betray him, however, after over a decade of protection and cooperation. Still, the Party's Central Committee has hatched a plan: Seize key buildings in Guangzhou and force Chen Jiongming, who has strong misgivings about fighting in the city, to surrender.\n\nAll Chen Mingshu has to do is give the order.
