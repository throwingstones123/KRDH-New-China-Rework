name = "The Southern Zhili Clique" 
desc = "EVT_140000_DESC" #Nominally under the control of the Xuangtong Emperor's government in Beijing, the reality in Southeastern China is much different than that of the northern provinces. Sun Chuanfang rules his now League of Eight Provinces to extend Zhili - and thus Qing - rule throughout southern China, particularly the former Kuomintang territories of Guangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan. While pledging fealty to Beijing, the alliance between Sun and the Zhili-run Qing government to the north is significantly strained. Rivalry between the two Zhili factions has existed for years, but as of late Sun Chuanfang has made many independent concessions and agreements to the German AOG in exchange for military and industrial support, which has led Sun's Southern Zhili to become defacto autonomous from the North. These concessions, however, combined with the rampant corruption have made Sun very unpopular in LEP territory, particularly with the anti-concessionists supported by Chen Tiaoyuan, governor of Anhui. Sun also has to contend with KMT remnants being housed in Tang Jiyao's Yunnan clique to the west, which may be itching to reclaim their base in the South and launch another revolution. Rumor also has it that other KMT remnants still fester within our own provinces, and are organizing a revolt of their own. Ambition and intrigue are about in the League and threaten its integrity - some say Sun and the Southern Zhili's days are numbered before the inevitable overcomes them...

name = "The AOG" 
desc = "EVT_140001_DESC" #The Allgemeine Ostasiatische Gesellschaft (AOG) is a joint-stock company that administers the Kaiserreich's concessions in China. While they do not officially control much territory of their own, they hold an incredible amount of influence in the League of Eight Provinces in particular. The AOG provides military and infrastructure support to Sun Chuanfang's Southern Zhili government, as well as runs much of its banking and industry. Thanks to this position, the AOG is able to frequently twist the arm of Sun Chuanfang's government, and more than a few AOG officials take part in the corruption that is rampant in the warlord regime. Sun's collaboration with the AOG has made him a very unpopular figure in his own realm, and his Clique more or less relies on the AOG to keep itself running. Even if Sun were to fall, it is likely the AOG will find a new puppet to support, in the name of maintaining their - and Germany's - own financial, industrial, military, and political interests in China.
