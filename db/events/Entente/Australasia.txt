desc = EVT_100000_DESC # Formed in 1924 as a result of the Consolidation Of Resources Act, the Australasian Confederation is the combination of the British Antipode Dominions, Australia and New Zealand, as well as the territories of British New Guinea and Fiji. The years since the Weltkrieg, in which Australian and New Zealand forces served with distinction, have brought great change and hardship. The war strained both society and the economy, which in Australia manifested itself in the short lived Melbourne Commune. Although disowned by the then ruling Labour government and put down by demobilised Australian Imperial Force veterans, this resulted in the implementation of the Emergency Protocols, the suspention of elections and the appointment of William Birdwood as Governor General. Then the British Revolution of 1925 shook the Empire to the core and Australasia was unable to prevent the loss of territories to the Germans. More than 10 years on the situation is still unstable as the economy remains
# stagnante and domestic dissent continues to grow; with Birdwood alongside his ally Billy Hugh's Nationalist Party, barely holding things together.

desc = EVT_100001_DESC # Elections in the Antipodes were suspended by the Emergency Protocols enacted in 1923 which also led to the dissolving of the autonomy of the seperate New Zealand Parliament. However, elections are now set for March this year after Stanley Bruce successfully campaigned for their reintroduction. Governor-General Birdwood was forced to make this concession when Bruce defeated Hughes for the leadership of the Nationalist Party and although Bruce's descision not to act as unelected Prime Minister resulted in the expulsion of his faction from the Nationalist Party and Hughes' recall as PM, the public would not accept the government reneging on it's commitments. Australasia can ill afford a repeat of 1929 - the spectre of Melbourne remains fresh in the minds of many.

Lang was originally excluded as a result of his dismissal from government by the contemporary governor of NSW, Philip Game. A powerful orator and a populist through and through, the readmittance of Lang has caused consternation amongst the more leftist members of the Labour Party who alongside the majority of trade union activists see him more as a social feudalist inherently hostile to true socialist doctrine. It seems that the Australasian Labour Party is heading into a turbulent time, given the immenant election.

desc = EVT_100004_DESC # Originally formed in 1925, the Australasian 'New' Guard is a staunchly nationalist and jingoistic organisation which can trace its roots back to the paramilitary organisations of demobilised servicemen returning from the Great War (the 'Old' Guard) who helped put down the 1923 Melbourne Commune. In the years following the Victoria rising, the New Guard have continued to support the government, with many supporters joining the expanded security forces available to the Governor-General and New Guard members assisting in suppressing left wing activities. The coming return to democratic rule has caused an upset amongst the far right however, fearing the re-emergance of the long suppressed Labour movement and that the Nationalist Party, divided as it is between the Guard and United Australasia will be unable to maintain the status quo. Due to these factors, the New Guard's leader Eric Campbell, has decided that the Guard will take part in the elections as the Centre                                                # Party. Despite their not inconsiderable levels of popular support, at present it is unsure what impact they will have though.

While Canada, the most senior British colony was able to facilitate the Exodus from the Home Isles and secure British posessions in the New World, Australasia wasn't in a position to mount comparable operations in the Pacific. This resulted in territory being lost to foreign powers, foremostly the German Reich. Admiral David Murray Anderson, commander of the China Station in 1925, enacted what would later be termed the 'Anderson Protocol' where he evacuated colonial personal and civilians to Australasia, there combining the British fleet with the Australasians to form the current Australasian Station. Now that Australasia is once again beginnning to asert it's independence many are calling for a clarification of the governments foreign policy. The most obvious course is to reafirm our commitment to the Entente alliance, while others are suggesting we distance ourselfs from it in order to better develop                         # our own nation. Anderson, the sitting Governor of New South Wales is calling for a renewed Australasia to commit to completing what she was unable to accomplish in 1925 - the reclamation and protection of the British territories in Asia and the Pacific region. While dangerously revanchist, this 'Anderson Doctrine' is fast gaining popularity.

This 'Great Schism' of the Australasian Labour Party has firmly separated the Antipodean worker's movement into a reformist and populist rump Labour Party and a revolutionary movement consolidating around the Australasian Council of Trade Unions.

In Australia, two consecutive plebsticies about the introduction of conscription were narrowly defeated, leaving the ANZACs and other Antipodean units strictly volunteer-only. However, with the Entente's defeat and the ensuring German expansion in the Pacific following the 1925 British Revolution, the federal government has been anxious about strengthening the fighting capabilities of the Australasian army, navy and air force. Today, the results of the National Defence Review have proposed increasing the military's training strength and funding as a result of the rising tension in Europe and Asia. Some see it as a staging point for the government to launch a campaign arguing for the introduction of conscription and the need for a swift militarization of the Antipodean dominions.

Several governments had attempted to enforce it through plebiscites, but were defeated - sometimes narrowly - at the polling stations. However, several leading members of the incumbent administration argue that the time has come for a new attempt at replacing the volunteer ANZAC forces with a conscription-based and better trained armed forces. Such a 'conscription campaign' could either strengthen the government if successful or potentially break it - and thus strengthening the extremes of Australasia's political scene - if failing. Either way, the amount of money the government is prepared to spend on this campaign will be an indicator of failure as well as success.

However, complications have arisen since New Zealand overwhelmingly voted no to confederate conscription whilst Australians mainly voted yes. Although a majority for conscription has been achieved, it would be dangerous for our nation's union to impose it on the New Zealanders. Some members of cabinet have proposed that we let the various administrative regions implement conscription on a local level, thus allowing the Kiwis to maintain their volunteer-based army units.

While the results showed that the RAN is still a force to be reckoned with, it is beginning to fall behind the other powers in the Pacific. A number of our ships are now considerably out of date and the lack of modern capital ships is a noticable weakness. To rectify this a programme of modernisation has been proposed to bring the older vessels up to speed. Expanding our number of capital ships has also been suggested, but as we are currently lacking the advanced shipyards and drydocks required we would either have to begin a significant infrastucture project to enable Australasia to buil these ships ourselves. An alternative to this is to instead tender this contract out to another country's shipbuilders.

For the soldiers of the Military Districts stationed in Canberra, many of them also veterans of the Great War, a hard choice must be made. Either turn their guns upon the supporters of a man many of them consider a hero or stand aside and allow him to overthrow the democratically elected government of Australasia.

Sharing his fate is Eric Campbell, a senior figure in the New Guard movement and leader of it's political wing - the Centre Party, as well as many other prominent members. The New Guard has now been dissolved and the Centre Party banned. Charles Vyner Brooke unfortunately could not be linked directly to the coup and so escaped a prison sentence, although many say he bribed those involved in his prosecution. He has since distanced himself from public life, much to the satisfaction of the present government.

Despite fighting together alongside Britain in the Great War and staying true to the Empire after 1925, succesive Canadian governments have continued to keep Australasia at arms length due in no small part to a protectionist attitude - not wishing for their own farmers to be out competed by Australasian imports. As such, no bilateral trade agreement exists between the two Dominions. Now however, with Canada's increasing military build-up to prepare for the retaking of the Home Islands and the collapse in trade with the United States due to the instability there, the Canadians may be amenable to allowing us to increase exports to them. This would allow Canada to release men and resources for other war-related services, such as the military or arms production.

In Africa, South East Asia and the Indian and Pacific Oceans, Germany occupied the far flung outposts of the British Empire, left vulberable by the loss of the Home Islands. The situation was different however in China where the presence of the other international powers, wary of the Reich dominating foreign trade, helped to maintain the status quo - this lead ultimately to the formation of the Legation Cities. The British concessions have largely integrated into this system - the Governor of Hong Kong, Cecil Clementi, is the current head of the Legations Council and former British colonial units make up a significant part of the Legations defence forces. The primary conduit of international trade in and out of China, the Legation Cities amass considerable profits for their foreign owners, ourselves among them. This makes the Legations a target for every nationalist organisation in China 		       # who wish to see their reincorporation and corruption, in the form of the local triads, is endemic.

This has seen an economic boom in Kuching and Brunei, where infrastructure has been expanded. In the face of all this rapid change, Charles Brooke's popularity with his erstwhile subjects remains good, largely due to his hands-off approach which fosters native traditions.

desc = EVT_100196_DESC # With the resignation of Governor-General Birdwood, a new wave of political publishing has sprung up across all of Australasia. While most publications expressed their relief now that democracy and free speech have been restored in Australasia, some turn to agitation and demagoguery to gain attention. One of the most prominent so far has been Percy Reginald Stephensen's The Foundations of Culture in Australasia, which gives a detailed account of what the author called "Australasian self-defeatism". Himself a former member of the Syndicalist Party of Australasia, Stephensen grew disillusioned after the failure of the Melbourne Commune and gradually shifted to the right. Now a staunch nationalist, Stephensen wishes to foster a sense of "Antipodeanism", which calls on Australasians to embrace their own unique identity as an independent nation rather than continuing to act as a dependent extension of Europe, and less evidently, of the Entente. Stephensen's work has already gained a massive following, showing a clear testimony to the unpopularity of the Birdwood government.

An emerging literary group that shares these views is the Jindyworobak Society, which has published its manifesto own manifesto written by its founder Rex Ingamells. 'Conditional Culture' took heavy inspiration from Stephensen's work, noticeable through its rejection of continued British influence and support for Stephensen's 'Antipodeanism' program, which they hailed as the first authentic political breakthrough in Australasia. There are rumors of further plans between Ingamells and Stephensen, which some say will lead to the formation of a new political party

Already local A.F.M branches have sprung up across all of Australasia, signaling the participation of a dark horse candidate in an already very tense election. Though the A.F.M's official doctrine has been watered down to avoid charges of being unconstitutional, many expect that sharp changes would be enacted or even a referendum on the monarchy would be held if Stephensen secures the premiership.

Though no animals or personnel were harmed as the Zoo had already evacuated all of its residents as it was closing down soon, inquiries are being made into any individuals or groups that may have a motive in setting Hobart Zoo ablaze. Many suspect a local group of P.R Stephensen enthusiasts to be behind this outrage, as they have heavily criticized the Zoo's role in Benjamin, the last Tasmanian tiger's death. However, police investigations so far have not been able to link any members to the arson.

His debut novel, Capricornia, has just won the Commonwealth's 150th Anniversary Literary Award. Capricornia provides a fictional account of life in 'Capricornia', a region that bears a close resemblance to the Northern Territory. The novel, like other works by Herbert, is immense and verbose, following the fortunes of a range of Outback Characters through generations. Their story has reflected a story of Australia, concerning the clash of personalities and civilizations that provide the basis on which our society is founded. Australasia First has celebrated the fact the award is going towards one of their own, though they've also taken this chance to denounce our discriminatory policies towards the Aboriginal population.

The Aboriginal Progressive Association and Australian Aboriginals' League, with support from Australasia First, have organized mass protests across New South Wales and Victoria, demanding Birdwood-era officials who were responsible for the heavy crackdowns on Aboriginal activists be put on trial. The rallies also serve as a reminder of the bloody legacy of British colonialism. The APP also calls for great reforms in the way our government deals with First Nation peoples. One of their notable proposals is for us to create a 'Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs', whose members are to be nominated by the APP and AAL. Though these protests are not unheard of, the scale of the ongoing ones and the support of many white Australasia First members have made it hard for us to ignore their calls.

The documents were detailed instructions of how the New Guard government should act in the aftermath of a successful coup, while others were reports of equipment being smuggled to Blamey and his cronies. One especially alarming document is instructions for the internment of the entirety of Australasia First's leadership, with Stephensen marked out for execution.

Considering that the wars of the future will be fought in the air, this is a grave concern for the ANZAC High Command. However, it is not just aircraft that we are currently falling behind at. Australasia's air defense is at an abysmal state right now, barely able to fight off monoplanes and biplanes, much less new fighters and bombers. Airbase distribution is also a concern, as our airfields are sparse and unevenly spread, leaving the Northern Territory and Queensland exposed to a hypothetical German invasion from Papua. All of these problems combined make reforming the RAAF a matter of life or death for Australasia.
