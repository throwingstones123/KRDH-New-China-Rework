### IMPORTANT FLAGS
#	END_ACW 	- THE ACW IS OVER
#			Basic flag used to prevent some events from firing
#			if ACW is still going on.
#	AUS_YOUTH 	- Pelley'S YOUTH PROGRAM APPROVED (NEW FLAG)
#			Put in vanilla KR event that fires usually during ACW.
#			I intend for this to be used to increase Pelley's
#			power base if he launches his coup or is elected
#			just incase player wants to go dictatorship route
#	AUS_WEALTH 	- SHARE THE WEALTH
#			Signifies that Long has passed his Share The Wealth program.
#			This is one of several issues extremists and business forces
#			oppose vehemently.
#	LONG_TARIFF 	- LONGS TARRIF
#			Only currently used by one event, activated if tarrif
#			is passed. Might be room for expansion later 
#	NO_IND_SEC_ACT 	- INDUSTRIAL SECURITY ACT NOT PASSED
#			This flag is from the vanilla KR, but never used.
#			I intend to change that. Not passing the ISA should have
#			long term consequences, generally negative but perhaps
#			positive if Long can rally the unions to his cause somehow
#	LONG_EXILE 	- AMERICAN LEFTISTS EXILED 
#			Flag activated if player decides to exile instead of hang
#			the CSA leadership that has not escaped the country. Unsure
#			if the flag is currently used elsewhere. Not used here.
#			Could possibly be useful later, however. Either for leftist
#			insurrections or some sort of agreement between Long and left.
#	AUS_DEC_IND 	- INDUSTRIAL DECENTRALIZATION ACT
#			Flag from very interesting event. Not used at all in vanilla KR.
#			The IDA dismantles a few factories in the rust belt if passed.
#			Vanilla KR offered no motivation for the player to do this beyond
#			flavor. I intend to use this flag to prevent trouble later on if
#			the IDA is passed, particularly in a war versus syndies if the
#			unions havent been defeated or reconciled with. Compare with ISA
#	Election Flags	- VARIOUS ELECTION FLAGS
#			Used to calculate winner of elections due to three tier system.
#			Flags removed following end of election. I intend to re-use some
#			of these same flags for future elections but generally they are
#			not used outside of them.
#	AUS_YOUTH 	- Pelley'S YOUTH PROGRAM APPROVED (NEW FLAG)
#			Vanilla KR event that fires usually during ACW.
#			I intend for this to be used to increase Pelley's
#			power base if he launches his coup or is elected
#			just incase player wants to go dictatorship route
#	AUS_BLACK_UNITS - BLACK UNITS APPROVED (NEW FLAG)
#			New flag activated by vanilla event in ACW event file
#			If the player or AI chooses to allow blacks to fight for the AUS
#			this flag is activated and may affect internal politics.
#			Black veterans may push more strongly for civil rights reform.
