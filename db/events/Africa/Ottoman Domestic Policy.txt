desc = "EVT_15000_DESC" #Welcome to Kaiserreich’s Ottoman Empire! A country racked by domestic turbulence the Ottoman Empire is currently in a very difficult position. However, fear not for reform is possible! The nature of reform is, however, a divided issue and three political groupings vie for mastery of the beleaguered Empire; The Committee of Union and Progress (authoritarian democrats under Mustafa Kemal) The Freedom and Accord Party (Liberals and pro-minority politicians under Prince Mehmed Sabâhaddin) and The Rumeli Party (Pan-Turkists and all-round reactionaries under Yusuf Akçura and Nihal Atsiz). Between 1936 and 1938 (Mustafa Kemal’s passing) you’ll face several different political issues such as the Arab problem, minority rights, army reform and the quest for economic recovery. Each of these events will have choices favoured by either of the three factions that influence the strength of the growing reform movement within the Ottoman parliament. There are 270 seats in the Ottoman chamber of deputies and if the country is to survive you need the backing of at least 150 members. The reform movement is currently supported by 90 members. It is suggested that you stay clear of the most extreme options if you fancy keeping the empire from imploding. The choice is, of course, all yours. Good luck!

Effectively repulsing the Entente attempt at forcing the Dardanelles and seizing Constantinople, the victory at Gallipoli remained the only major military success of the Porte during the Weltkrieg and paved the way for the commanding officer, Mustafa Kemal Pasha’s career as Grand Vizier. Parades, celebratory manifestations and speeches are held throughout the empire, fostering a rare example of state-patriotism shared by our subjects - be they Turk, Kurd or Arab.

Besides his work as a journalist and academic, Akçura was highly influential within the Pan-Turkist (also known as Turanist) Movement - being regarded by some as the unofficial leader of the grouping. His place in the Ottoman parliament has been filled by the young Nihal Atsiz who alongside Sadri Maksudi Arsal, Ethem Nejat and the disgraced field marshal Enver Pasha are expected to assume leadership over the Pan-Turkists.

At a recent congress in Cairo, the independent Arab states led by Egypt and the Hashemite kingdom have concluded a pact to actively work for the separation of our Arab vilayets and their ascension to either of the irredentist Arab states. Although some level of rapprochement between the Turkish and Arab parts of our empire has happened since 1921, the aggressive rhetoric of the nationalists threatens to destroy this hard-won amiability. The government must address the issue of Arab separatism, lest the vilayets of Syria and Iraq degenerate into sedition and civil war.

Consequently, the various political groupings at court have very varied attitudes towards addressing the problem. Kemal Pasha’s CUP maintain that a vague definition of Ottomanism of equal rights for all the Sultan’s subjects (though under Turkish leadership) as the way to go, whilst the Liberals advance the claim that the running of the empire must become completely egalitarian for all ethnicities and religious groupings. The Rumeli Party vehemently argue that only the Turkish race is suited for controlling the future of the Ottoman state and that all minorities become completely subservient to its Pan-Turanist ideals.

Thus the completion of the Baghdad railway served as a major point of contention between the British and the Central Powers and ultimately helped pave the road for war between the great powers. After years of negotiations and the bankrolling of investments from Mitteleuropa and America, the railroad is finally ready for completion and only the very last amount of cash is needed from the Ottoman government. However, some within the government believe that the funds should be spent on alleviating the citizens of the Empire suffering from the ongoing economic crisis. This would certainly improve the empire’s current stability, but weaken the unity of the state in the long run.

It has been suggested by the cabinet that the state initiate a series of reforms of the agrarian sector which would include land reform and investments in the new peasant small holders. This could solidify the Ottoman economy, but would also greatly upset the landed aristocracy.
