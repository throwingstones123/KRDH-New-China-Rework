Long servants of the Porte, this changed in 1911 when Italy defeated the Ottomans and took control of what was the province of Tripolitania. During the Weltkrieg, The Sennusi revolted, but were defeated. During this time Idris I would rise to prominence in keeping The Sennusi order alive and fighting, hoping to win independence. When Italy later surrendered to the Central Powers in 1919, the Ottomans regained Libya as part of their Empire. Idris was exiled into Egypt, and a more loyal Ottoman administration was installed. However, despite their victory in the Weltkrieg, The Sublime Porte proved weak. Through the 1920’s, Tripolitania remained loyal and mostly stable. But events elsewhere in the Islamic world might change that. In 1925 Egypt became independent from the British, and now are itching to rally the Arabs to the cause of throwing off Turkish hegemony in the region. The Ottomans may well struggle to retain control of the region, and Idris is still very much at large…
